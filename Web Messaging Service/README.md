# Web Discord type messaging service

This was a 2 man team project where i wrote the backend of the discord/skype type messaging program. I was in charge of designing and implementing the backend. Used this applicaton to really focus on the refining my skills in applying design (ACID) principles.

I implemented this using Node.js in the Express.js web sframework. It handles various API endpoints for user authentication, channel management, message handling, and more. The code demonstrates a modular structure, with organized route handlers, middleware usage, and integration with a database for data processing."

### Running the server

To run the server, go to root and execute:

```bash
npm start
```

This starts server on the port in the `src/server.ts` file, using `ts-node`.
