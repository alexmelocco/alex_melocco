# Projects

- Custom Handwritten Digit Recognition Neural Network
  
Implemented a HDR algorithm in python without the use of libaries such as Tensorflow or Pytorch. Independently researched and designed a custom, vectorised dense-layer type neural network architecture.

The design is modular, such that the framework can be used to create any neural network, of any size, purpose, layer amount, function type, etc in any aspect. Current implementation trains on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset.

Reason for project - wanted to better understand the underlying operations of a machine learning models, instead of relying on prewritten libraries in tensorflow and pytorch soley. This hopefully increases my perception in debugging and all aspects of ML

Current model can recognise digits 0-9 (after training has resulted in up to 97.5% accuracy on 10,000 unseen examples).
