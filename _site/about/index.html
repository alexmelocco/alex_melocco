<p>Thank you for visiting my blog. I am super passionate about machine learning research, and also tinkering with ML models in various applications. I usually work on multiple projects at a time, so when i complete them I will upload them here :).</p>

<p>My professional background comprises of softwre engineering roles that span startups, tech comapanys, banks, where I most recently worked at National Australia Bank. Here, I worked on transformative projects, where I was part of a team leading the revamp of their internal employee evaluation software.</p>

<p>I also am passionate about founding startups, and over the past 3 years, alongside my cofounders, have created three different technology startups.</p>

<p>If you want to see all of the projects I have published, they are available in <a href="https://github.com/alexmelocco/alex_melocco">my public GitHub repository</a>. If you want to message me directly, i am most responsive on <a href="www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-melocco-bb7604232">my linkedin</a> or via my email at alexjmelocco@gmail.com.</p>
