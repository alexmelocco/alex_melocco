# Client/server messaging and streaming service (backend networking)

Multi-threaded Server/client socket program appliaction which is able to send tcp/udp packets WITHOUT the use of api's. Server can support multiple client ocnnections trhough multithreaded, synchronous programming. User authentication amongst others are just some examples of its high level functionality.

Motivations for project - Interested with inner workings of messaging services and socket programming, rather than utilise APIâ€™s learn from scratch using socket programming techniques. Intending to create the corresponding front end later on.

Currently implemented within the terminal, future motivations to implement of frontend for this program.

See [Server.py](server.py) and [Client.py](client.py) for the two programs.

Note: all of the other accompanying files are either logs generated in testing (the server has a logging system) or video files (to test UDP transfer of videO)
