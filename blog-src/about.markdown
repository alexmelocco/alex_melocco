Thank you for visiting my blog. I am super passionate about machine learning research, and also tinkering with ML models in various applications. I usually work on multiple projects at a time, so when i complete them I will upload them here :).

My professional background has spanned startups, to big tech, the major banks, where I most recently worked at National Australia Bank. Here, I worked on transformative projects, where I was part of a team leading the revamp of their internal employee evaluation software.

If you want to see all of the projects I have published, they are available in [my public GitHub repository](https://github.com/alexmelocco/alex_melocco). If you want to message me directly, i am most responsive on [my linkedin](www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-melocco-bb7604232) or via my email at alexjmelocco@gmail.com.
